	A Turing machine is an abstract machine that manipulates
	symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules; to be more
	exact, it is a mathematical model of computation that defines such a
	device. Despite the model's simplicity, given any computer algorithm, a
	Turing machine can be constructed that is capable of simulating that
	algorithm's logic.
	<br />
	<br /> The machine operates on an infinite memory tape divided into
	discrete cells. The machine positions its head over a cell and "reads"
	(scans) the symbol there.
	<br /> Then, as per the symbol and its present place in a finite table
	of user-specified instructions, the machine (i) writes a symbol (e.g. a
	digit or a letter from a finite alphabet) in the cell (some models
	allowing symbol erasure and/or no writing), then (ii) either moves the
	tape one cell left or right (some models allow no motion, some models
	move the head), then (iii) (as determined by the observed symbol and
	the machine's place in the table) either proceeds to a subsequent
	instruction or halts the computation.
	<br />
	<br /> The Turing machine was invented in 1936 by Alan Turing, who
	called it an a-machine (automatic machine). With this model, Turing was
	able to answer two questions in the negative: (1) Does a machine exist
	that can determine whether any arbitrary machine on its tape is
	"circular" (e.g. freezes, or fails to continue its computational task);
	similarly, (2) does a machine exist that can determine whether any
	arbitrary machine on its tape ever prints a given symbol. Thus by
	providing a mathematical description of a very simple device capable of
	arbitrary computations, he was able to prove properties of computation
	in general—and in particular, the uncomputability of the
	Entscheidungsproblem ("decision problem"). 
	<br />
	<br />Thus, Turing machines prove
	fundamental limitations on the power of mechanical computation.[16]
	While they can express arbitrary computations, their minimalistic
	design makes them unsuitable for computation in practice: real-world
	computers are based on different designs that, unlike Turing machines,
	use random-access memory. Turing completeness is the ability for a
	system of instructions to simulate a Turing machine. A programming
	language that is Turing complete is theoretically capable of expressing
	all tasks accomplishable by computers; nearly all programming languages
	are Turing complete if the limitations of finite memory are ignored.
